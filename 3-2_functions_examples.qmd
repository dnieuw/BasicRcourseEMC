### Built-in Named Functions

R has an extensive set of built-in functions, a few of which are listed below:

First six elements/rows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head()
```

Last six elements/rows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tail()
```

Generate a sequence of values:

```{r}
seq(from=1, to=10, by=2)
```

Create numbers from string numbers:

```{r}
as.numeric(c("1","2","3","4"))
```

Sort a vector alphabetically or numerically:

```{r}
sort(c(3,4,2,5,1))
```

Retrieve the maximum value from a vector:

```{r}
max(c(111,333,444,55,6,777,999))
```

Generate 10 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1:

```{r}
rnorm(10)
```
