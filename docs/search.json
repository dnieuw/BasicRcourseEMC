    "text": "1.2 Saving and restoring your session\nSave all objects to the working directory in a file called .RData:\n\nsave.image()\n\nOr give the file a name:\n\nsave.image(\"mySession.RData\") \n\nSave all commands entered into the R console during your session to the working directory in a file called .Rhistory:\n\nsavehistory()\n\nSuch a file may be hidden by default in some file browsers, including linux.\nNote that this typically occurs (console dependent) by default when you quit your R session. If an .Rhistory file already exists from a previous session, the current session is appended to the end of this file and saved. Thus, by design, a complete log of your work is saved together with your script file, if your console session contains less than 512 lines.\nSave specific objects:\n\nsave(object_1, object_2, object_3, file = \"rObjects123.RData\")\n\nRestore or load previous sessions or objects:\n\nload(\"mySession.RData\")        # load from the working directory\n\nWhen you save and load objects this way, loaded variables will have the same names as when they were stored. There is also a different way of saving objects where loaded objects are assigned explicitly.\n\nmyobject &lt;- list(vec=c(1, 2, 3), mat=matrix(1:4,2))\nsaveRDS(myobject,file = 'myfile.rds')\nobject2 &lt;- readRDS('myfile.rds')\nidentical(myobject, object2)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nOften the data we want to use is not in any ‘R-format’ but in another format. We will then have to import this data. Much of this functionality is included in the foreign package. To open data from spss you can use the read.spss command from this package. The syntax is:\n\nlibrary(foreign)\nread.spss(file = 'path/to/file/thespssfile.sav', to.data.frame = TRUE)\n\nUsing the argument to.data.frame we indicate that we want the result as a data.frame. Another format that is often used is excel sheets; for this we can use the read_excel function from the readxl package.\n\nread_excel(path='path/to/file/excelworkbook.xls')\n\nThis function has an optional argument sheet to indicate the sheet in the excel file if it contains multiple sheets. Optionally, with range a cell range can be indicated.\nLoad .Rhistory file to access the history from the console:\n\nloadhistory()",

How many patients (and %) are in each category?\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\nFor a current analysis, I am only interested in the patients with “Healthy weight”. Additionally, I only want to look at the relation between Status and birthweight. Make a data set with only these two variables and patientnumber, for a subset of the data with the patients with “Healthy weight”.\nWhat are the dimensions of this data set? First try to think yourself and then check with R code.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\nMake a third data set containing the variables: patientnumber, Status and BMI. Then merge the data set you created in Question 7 with this data set.\nMerging these two data sets can be done several different ways. Describe two ways. What are the dimensions of these data sets?\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\nThere are several biomarkers collected in the data set.

Write down the equation for the regression model.\nEstimate the regression model and evaluate the residuals. Are the assumptions of the model met?\nThe residuals look a bit skewed.

The chunk again is ended by writing three backticks. So the whole thing looks like this\n```{r}\n1 + 1\n```\nOptionally you can also include a chunk name after the name of the language. This helps if there are any errors as the chunk name will be included in the error message. Additionally figures that are created within the code will use the chunk name in the name of the figure.\n```{r examplename}\n````\n\nBy default, when the document is rendered the code in the chunks will be executed and both the contents of the code block as the output will be included in the document.

A given ducument can include manu code chunks that all will be executed in order. Variables that are defined in a certain code block can be used in the following ones, just as if the code would have formed a single R-script.\n\n## Chunk Options\n\nIt is possible to modify the behavior of how the code blocks are executed. This is done by including special comments at the top of the code blocks. Alternatively we can include them between the braces.

    "text": "We will continue analyzing the file R_data2.csv, the data about children with intellectual disabilities. We are going to do an analysis in R using R markdown to produce an html file that contains both the documentation, code and the results. Unfortunately, because we create a dynamic document of our data analyses that changes as we go, it is a bit harder to provide hints and answers after every question in the same way as before. To help you, we provide a document with hints for most questions and a model ‘answer’ that reflects what the finished R markdown document may look like when you have answered all questions.\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nWe are going to make an R markdown document for our analysis. A convinient way to start editing such a document in R studio is by using the menu bar. Select ‘file’ -&gt; ‘New File’ -&gt; ‘R Markdown…’. This will open a dialog box where you can select the type of document you want to create. Select ‘Document’ and then ‘HTML’. Choose ‘Analysis of Intellectual Disabilities’ as a title and fill in your name. This will create a new R markdown document with some default text (which we will delete for the most part). Save this document somewhere on your computer or network.\nStructure the document by creating headers for the different sections. You can use the following headers: ‘Introduction’, ‘Data’, ‘Analysis and Results’ and ‘Conclusion and Discussion. You can also add a header ’Setup’ where you load the necessary libraries and the data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn new versions of R you can also use a ‘quarto document’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nNow we are going to load the data set R_data2.csv into R. To do so insert a code chunk in the setup section. You can do this by choosing ‘Code &gt; ’Insert Chunk’ from the menu. Now begin to enter the necessary code (check the practical from day 2 if needed to see how this can be done). Call the imported data set ‘dat’.\nAt this point try to ‘knit’ or ‘render’ the document to see if there are no errors. You can check this at the end of every question.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nCreate a new code chunk in the ‘Data’ section of your document. This is where we will clean the data and apply the necessary transformations.\n\nDefine the variable pregnancy_length by adding together the weeks and days as you have done in the practical about data cleaning.\nDefine the variable BMI_cat by dividing the variable BMI into categories: &lt;18.5 (“Underweight”), 18.5 - 24.9 (“Healthy weight”), 25 - 29.9 (“Overweight”), and &gt;30 (Obesity).\nlog transform homocysteine and vitaminB12.\nTransform the categorical variables to factors. For the Status variable. Make sure that “normal brain development” is the first so it will be used as reference in the logistic regression we will do later.\nRemove the original variables pregnancy_length_weeks, pregnancy_length_days, BMI and homocysteine and vitaminB12 from the data set, we will not use them any further.\nAdd a short text underneath the code chunk explaining what you have done.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nIt is always a good idea to get to know your data. To this and add a subsection to the ‘Analysis and Results’ section where you compute the mean and standard for all continuous variables in the data set and the frequency of all categorical variables. You might want to use your knowledge of loops (see the material from the 3rd day of the course) to do this efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages\n\n\n\nThere are a number of useful packages to create tables of descriptive like this. Because it is beyond the scope of this course we will not use them here. However you might be interested in checking out the table1, and gtsummary package.\n\n\nAlso add a histogram of the continuous variables.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nAdd a subsection “Unadjusted Analysis” to the ‘Analysis and Results’ section where you compare the mean of the logarithm of the Vitamin B12 for the two levels of Status (normal brain development or intellectual disability).\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nAdd a subsection adjusted analysis to the ‘Analysis and Results’ section where you perform logistic regression analysis to investigate the association between Status and log Vitamin B12 while adjusting for medication, smoking and alcohol.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\nNow adjust the text the text of the document to better explain what you have done.\nEnd your document with a paragraph of conclusions. Use bold text an unnumbered list to summarize the main points.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\nChange the options of the code chunks in your document that do the data transformations to prevent showing the code and messages. This will make the document more readable at the expense of no longer being fully transparent.\nAlso check what happens if you add code_folding: hide to the YAML header of your document (under html_document).\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9 (Optional if you have time)\n\n\nOutliers can have a large effect on results. For the purpose of this practical we will consider all observations that are 3 standard deviations away from the mean as outliers. In the data section transform the data set by truncating the outliers to the value of the mean plus or minus 3 times the standard deviation. This is called ‘Winsorizing’. Try to write your own function to do this using what you have learned during day 3 of the course. For Winsorizing homocysteine and vitaminB12 are analysed on the log scale.\nRerun your analyses. Describe what you have done in the text. Adjust your conclusions if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nObviously in a real life situation the handling of outliers would require some more thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10 (Optional if you have time)\n\n\nIt has been discovered that a mistake has been made in the construction of the data set. Some participants have accidentally been excluded while others have been excluded while they should not have been. The file extra.Rdata contains data of new participants that should be included. The data ineexcl.Rdata contains the ‘ids’ of patients that should be excluded.\nAdjust your data to reflect this new information. Rerun your analysis and adjust your conclusions if needed.",

    "text": "Introduction\nShiny is a tool that allows you to quickly make interactive applications using R that nicely works together with RStudio. You can run the apps on your own computer or host them on a server (for example using Posit Cloud). Before you can run Shiny apps you need to install the shiny package (but if you do not RStudio will prompt you to install it).\n\ninstall.packages(\"shiny\")\n\n\n\nCreating an app\nThere are several ways of creating an shiny application. The easiest way is to use the menus in RSTudio. Click File &gt; New File &gt; Shiny Webb App. You are then presented with a dialog screen where you are asked to give the application a name and create a directory for the app. Nowadays the usual process is that a file app.R is created that contains the code for the user interface and the back end (this is explained later). These two parts used to have their own separate files (ui.R and server.R) and you can still choose this option in the dialog screen. For larger application splitting the code over several files can make it easier to manage so this may still be an interesting option.\nWhen you are more experienced you can also start building an app by creating an app.R file in an empty directory yourself. You can quickly enter the boilerplate code typing shinyapp and pressing Shift-TabShift-Tab.\n\n\nParts of an app: user interface and back end\nIf you inspect the code of the shiny app you see that it consists of two parts: a user interface and the back end (server) part.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  # code to define the user interface goes here\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  # code to define the back end goes here\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n\n\n\nStarting and stopping the application\nWhen you want to run the app you can click on the Run App button in the tool bar of the source pane. You can also use the shortcut Ctrl-Shift-EnterCtrl-Shift-Enter. As a last option you can use the runApp() function giving the directory of the application as an argument.\nTo stop the application you can press the stop sign in the toolbar of the console pane, press escape when the R console pane is selected or simply close the application window.\n\n\nInput controls\nWe want our application to receive input from a user and be able to show results (that are based on this inputs) back to the user. These things are done using controls that are placed on the interface.\nLet us first look at input controls and change the ui to look like this:\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  sliderInput(\"n\",\n              \"Enter a number:\",\n              min = 1,\n              max = 10,\n              value = 2),\n  print('hello there')\n\n)\n\nHere ui takes a value from fluidpage. This is an example of a layout function that is a function that creates the layout of our application. A fluid page layout is a application layout that structures its elements in rows which may in turn have columns. Often the layout is given more structure by using further layout functions. Here we place a single input control on the fluid page which allows the user to select a number between 1 and 10 using a slider. The first argument to the function is the inputID, this is the name that we can use to refer to the value that the user has selected. The second argument is the label which is just that text that is displayed just above the slider. It is used to inform the reader what the function of the control is.\n\n\nThe server function\nThe function does not do anything at the moment. This is because the server function is empty. If we want to add functionality we need to add this to the body of this function. Let’s simulate the results of the total from some dice throws.\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  output$total &lt;- renderText({\n    sum(ceiling(runif(input$n, 0, 6)))\n  })\n}\n\nHere we are defining an output that is called total. This is done using a render function a function that tells R how a results should be displayed. The renderText function can be used for R object that can be displayed as text. As an argument to the function we give it the code that can be used to calculate the result.  Within this code we refer toinput$n` which is de number we have entered using the slider.\n\n\nOutput controls\nWhen we actually want to show the output we need to add the total output control to the user interface. This can been done as follows:\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  sliderInput(\"n\",\n              \"Enter a number:\",\n              min = 1,\n              max = 10,\n              value = 2),\n  textOutput(\"total\")\n\n)",

    "text": "The goal of this practical is to create a beautiful shiny application. The app’s goal is to show the Hoftiezer Birthweight curves and use these curves to determine the birthweight percentile of a certain infant.\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nDownload the hoftiezer.R file from canvas to get started. This file contains two functions you can use: phoftiezer and qhoftiezer. The first one calculates Hoftiezer Birthweight percentiles given Birthweight (in grams), gestational age (in days) and sex. The second function does the reverse and calculates Birthweight (in grams) given a percentile, gestational age and sex. Although you don’t need to know every detail about this function, being how to use it is crucial for the practical.\n\nUsing this function calculate the birthweight percentile of a boy with a gestational age of 200 days that weights 1500 grams. Also try to calculate the percentile for this given weight for all integer gestational ages between 210 and 220 days.\nUsing this function calculate the median birthweight of a girl with a gestational age of 200 days. Also calculate the P05 (5th percentile) for girls for all integer ages between 210 and 220.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nNow we are going to make our shiny app. While thee is a wizard to create shiny apps. Here we are going to start using a basic R file. To do this create a new directory for you app. Now create a new R file save it in this directory and give it the name app.R. Copy and paste the following code in this file:\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n    # Application title\n    titlePanel(\"Birthweight percentiles\")\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n# nothing here yet\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\nIf you save the file a green arrow should appear in the source toolbar in RStudio. When you click it the app will run! Of course the app will not do very much (it only shows it title). To stop the app either close the app window or click on the red stop sign on the R console toolbar.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nWe want our app to be able to calculate birthwight percentiles. Therefore it needs access to the qhoftiezer and phoftiezer functions. In order to do so you could simply copy and paste the code from hoftiezer.R to app.R. A slightly more elegant way is the source the contents of this file. Save the hoftiezer.R file in the directory you created. Now include the line source('hoftiezer.R') in the app.R file (just before the definition of ui is a good place). To test if the app can access the function we use in in the interface. The start of your file should now look like this\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nsource('hoftiezer.R')\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  # Application title\n  titlePanel(\"Birthweight percentiles\"),\n  phoftiezer(q = 0.5, ga = 220, sex='female')\n)\n\n# ...\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nWe now will modify the layout of the app to ask for user input at the left of the window and show its results to the right. In shiny this can be done by including a sidebarLayout within the fluidPage function. A function that in turn includes a sidebarpanel and a mainPanel function. The sidebarLayout should include controls that ask for an infacts birthweight, gestational age and sex. This is now used to calculate the birthweight percentile wich is shown in the main panel. We start with just a control to ask the user for birthweight and ask the other information later. Modify the ui to look like the following:\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n    # Application title\n    titlePanel(\"Birthweight percentiles\"),\n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n          numericInput(\"birthweight\",\n                        \"Birthweight in gramms:\",\n                        min = 100,\n                        max = 6000,\n                        value = 1000)\n    ),\n        # Show percentile\n        mainPanel(\n        phoftiezer(q = 0.5, ga = 220, sex='female')\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# ...\n\nWithin the numericInput function the first parameter specifies the inputId, the name we will use the refer to the value the user entered here. The second parameter specifies the label: This is just a text that is used to prompt the user for the value. The other arguments specify the minimum and maximum value that can be entered as well as the default value of the control.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nYou have probably noticed that in its present form the app doesn’t take any action based on the birth weight entered by the user. To address this, it’s essential to conduct the required calculations within our server function. Update the server function to resemble the following:\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  output$percentile &lt;- renderText({\n    phoftiezer(q = input$birthweight,\n               ga = 220,\n               sex = 'female')\n  })\n\nWith the assignment output$percentile &lt;- renderText(...) you define a Shiny output with the name percentile. The right-hand side features a render function, which, in this case, specifies that the calculated results should be displayed as text. Shiny offers various render functions tailored for different types of results, such as text, tables, plots, and more. Within phoftiezer function we now use input$birthweight indicating that the value in the input control that is called birthweight will be used in the calculations. To display the results from output$percentile, replace the phoftiezer function call in the main panel with textOutput(\"percentile\")\nVerify if the app behaves as you expect.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nAdditionally, we would like to be able specify the infants’ sex and gestational age. To do this we need to add two more controls to the sidebarPanel function. Use a sliderInput for gestational age and a selectInput for sex. Use the documentation to check how these functions work. Note that the input control functions need to be separated by commas. Modify the server function to use the input from these controls.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\nTo make our app somewhat better looking we are going to include a plot. To include the plot in the main panel include the line plotOutput(\"distPlot\") in the mainPanel function. Don’t forget to use commas to divide up the different controls. output$distPlot now needs to be defined within the server function. Define a series of gestational ages ranging from 161 to 294 within this function. Use this sequence to calculate the median birth weight using the qhoftiezer function. Do the same for the 5th and 95th percentile. Now plot these (for example using the matplopt function). Using the points function, add user input to the plot as the final step.",

    "section": "What is R and how do we use it",
    "text": "What is R and how do we use it\n\nDefinition(s)\n\nWikipedia: `R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software[7] and data analysis.’ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)\nComprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): `R is ``GNU S’‘, a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.’ https://cloud.r-project.org/.\nThe R Journal - Facets of R: `This paper considers six characteristics, which we will call facets. They characterize R as:\n\nan interface to computational procedures of many kinds;\ninteractive, hands-on in real time;\nfunctional in its model of programming;\nobject-oriented, “everything is an object”;\nmodular, built from standardized pieces; and,\ncollaborative, a world-wide, open-source effort.’\n\n\nBy John M. Chambers\n\nMy definition: A command based, object oriented and functional language; in contrast to excel which is a cell centric, spreadsheet managing graphical user interface (GUI).\n\n\n\nWorking with R\nYou type commands, also known as `expressions,'' into a text editor or terminal and send them toRfor evaluation.R` evaluates the command, prints the command (by default), then the result of the evaluated command, if any.\nThe simplest expressions equal simple calculations, similar to those we could do on a hand calculator\n&gt;1 + 1\n[1] 2\n&gt;1 - 1\n[1] 0\n&gt;2 * 3\n[1] 6\n&gt;2 / 3\n[1] 0.6666667\nHere we use ‘&gt;’ to denote the R prompt. It is used in the console to indicate that R is ready for a new command. The lines in between is the output given by R.\nBut we can also ‘call’ functions on an object. Most of the functionality in R comes from these functions. There are many functions we can use including the standard mathematical ones:\n&gt;cos(3.1415)\n[1] -1\n&gt;exp(0)\n[1] 1\n&gt;log(1)\n[1] 0\nThe results above are displayed but not stored. To do this we must give a name to the result. That is, we store the result in a variable. The results are now no longer displayed but using the variable name we can refer to it later.\nAssigning a result in a variable is done using &lt;-. For example:\n&gt;five &lt;- 3+2\n&gt; five\n[1] 5\n&gt; five + 1\n[1] 6\n\n\nHow we interact with R\nNot surprisingly everything about R is built on the principle of KISS, i.e., keep it simple stupid. * We get things done in R by typing commands and asking R to execute them with the ENTERENTER key. Assuming you know the commands, it couldn’t be any simpler. * The front end of R, the part that receives your terminal. You can type your commands directly into the terminal and hit {} to do your work. But if you need thousands of commands for a specific task, or want to share your method, this approach gets tiring fast. * Since the commands are just text, it’s easy to write a series of commands using any program built for working with text, i.e., text editors and word processors, to create code or a script, to get something done. * The easiest, most efficient way to write R code is using a text editor or integrated development environment, like RStudio or Emacs/ESS as mentioned earlier.\n\n\nRStudio: the easiest way to work with R\nFor most users, especially those new to R, RStudio is probably the best IDE to use. Like everything about R, you’re free to choose whatever editor you like. For Windows platforms, you could just use the basic editor that’s bundled with the downloadable installer. Let’s have a look at an RStudio ‘session’.\n\nThere are four panes:\n\nThe top left is the source pane. Do your typing in this pane.\nThe bottom left is your console. This is a window looking into what R is actually doing. Even though it’s fine to type your commands in this pane at the R '&gt;' prompt, avoid this: your commands are less conveniently stored and rerun than your source code in the editor pane.\nTop right: environment pane\nBottom left: files pane\n\nType your commands in the source pane and send them to R using the keyboard short-cut . This will send the line of code your cursor is on to R if no code is selected; or if there is code selected, then only the selected code is sent. Open RStudio on your PC and try it now. (Alternatively you can also pres the ‘Run’ icon just below the file tabs). Since programming is all about typing commands using a keyboard, not pointing and clicking, you might appreciate lots of keyboard shortcuts. Here’s an awesome cheatsheet of (RStudio keyboard shortcuts)[https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/].\nA few other things about RStudio:\n\nmove the focus between panes using the key board shortcuts Ctrl+1Ctrl+1 and Ctrl+2Ctrl+2 for the source and console panes respectively\nthe little asterisk next your source code file name indicates unsaved code\nsave your source code!",

    "text": "Backslashes\nOne more thing I want to mention is how R interprets backslashes and forwardslashes, i.e. \\ and / respectively, as relates to defining the locations of files on your PC. James McDonald does a better job of clarifying this than I otherwise would http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Lemon-kickstart/kr_scrpt.html:\n\nLet’s pause to note a little historical bifurcation that has caused Almost as much strife as the question of exactly what the DELETEDELETE key should do. The convention that the slash (/) character is used as a separator in the notation for a filesystem path is not universal. PC-DOS, for example, used the backslash \\. Like Fords vs Chevrolets, French vs English, and whether you crack the egg at the big or small end, it doesn’t really matter a rat’s behind which one you use as long as it works. To make it work in R, however, where the *NIX convention of using the backslash as an escape character is respected, you will have to double backslashes in paths for them to be read properly. Thus if the filename above was: ‘1.R’ I would have to refer to it as: ‘c:\\JIM\\PSYCH\\ADOLDRUG\\PARTYUSE1.R’ in an R script.",

The mode describes how the data is stored in R and how it can be used. Text variables for example have to be handled differently than numbers, we cannot multiply two words.\nElementary objects can be combined with each other to form more complex objects this leads to several types of containers, like lists and data.frames\nThe class of an object is an attribute that can be used to further specify how an object is used in R. For example it can be used to indicate how it should be printed and plotted. For many objects the class will simply be equal to the mode.\nFunctions are special objects that can do things with other objectsl, for example the print function displays the contents of an object in the console.

In R there is also no structure that is smaller than a vector. A single number is not treated differently from a numeric vector of length ten; In fact R sees the single number simply as a numeric vector of length 1. The length() of a vector can be obtained by using the function length().\nA vector can be created using the function c().

In general it is better not to trust this implicit conversion. Instead to it explicitly, in this case by using the function as.character().\nAn other way to create a vector is by using the function vector. vector('numeric', 8) creates a numeric vector of length 8. The vector function is often used to pre-allocate room where the results of future computations can be stored.",

If we use plot on one variable, the values of the variable will be plotted against their index, i.e., the order of the data within the object they’re stored:\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$len)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith two variables plot puts the first variable on the x-axis and the second variable on the y-axis (y versus x):\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$dose, ToothGrowth$len)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany parameters are available for customizing your plot. See ?par for an extensive list. We will just look at a couple here, like changing the axis labels:\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$dose, ToothGrowth$len, xlab = \"Dose\", ylab = \"Tooth Length\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also add a title:\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$dose, ToothGrowth$len, xlab = \"Dose\", ylab = \"Tooth Length\", main = \"Guinea Pig Tooth Growth by Dosage\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand even change the colors and characters of specific points:\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$dose, \n     ToothGrowth$len, \n     xlab = \"Dose\", \n     ylab = \"Tooth Length\", \n     main = \"Guinea Pig Tooth Growth by Dosage\", \n     col = ToothGrowth$supp, \n     pch = as.numeric(ToothGrowth$supp))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legend function adds a legend so we can easily identify which points represent which groups:\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$dose, ToothGrowth$len, xlab = \"Dose\", ylab = \"Tooth Length\", main = \"Guinea Pig Tooth Growth by Dosage\", col = ToothGrowth$supp, pch = as.numeric(ToothGrowth$supp))\n\nlegend(1.5, 15, c(\"OJ\", \"VC\"), col = 1:2, pch = 1:2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe location of the legend can also be specified by stating a region of the plot e.g. “bottomright” to place it in the very bottom righthand corner of the plot.\nThe argument cex stands for “character expansion” and will enlarge the size of points:\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$dose, ToothGrowth$len, xlab = \"Dose\",\n     ylab = \"Tooth Length\", main = \"Guinea Pig Tooth Growth by Dosage\",\n     col = ToothGrowth$supp, pch = as.numeric(ToothGrowth$supp),\n     cex = 2)\n\nlegend(1.5, 15, c(\"OJ\", \"VC\"), col = 1:2, pch = as.numeric(ToothGrowth$supp), cex=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Graphs\nTo create a plot using lines instead of points, we can actually still use plot, but we need to specify the type of plot we want, e.g.:\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$len, type = \"l\") # note type is the letter l for \"line\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$len, type = \"b\") # note type is the letter b for \"both\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add additional lines by calling lines:\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$len, type = \"l\")\nlines(ToothGrowth$len + 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line type, width, and color can be adjusted as follows:\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$len, type = \"l\")\nlines(ToothGrowth$len + 2, lty = 3, lwd = 3, col = \"darkgreen\")",

    "text": "Bar Charts and Histograms\n\nBar Charts\nViewing categorical data in a scatterplot often doesn’t make sense. For example, if we want to see the number of guinea pigs who received each dosage, the following doesn’t provide this information in the most intuitive format:\n\nplot(ToothGrowth$dose)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable(ToothGrowth$dose)\n\n\n0.5   1   2 \n 20  20  20 \n\n\n\nbarplot(table(ToothGrowth$dose))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot proportions instead of frequencies, as is often helpful (though not in this case):\n\nprops &lt;- table(ToothGrowth$dose)/nrow(ToothGrowth)\nprops\n\n\n      0.5         1         2 \n0.3333333 0.3333333 0.3333333 \n\n\n\nbarplot(props)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the y-axis doesn’t quite extend to the height of the bars. The range of the y-axis is easily change in plots by adjusting the parameter ylim (similarly xlim for the x-axis):\n\nbarplot(props, ylim = c(0, .4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet again, there are many parameters available for customizing the plot. Let’s try changing the width and colors of the bars:\n\nbarplot(props, ylim = c(0, .4), width = .2, col = c(\"blue\", \"white\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we can plot the bars horizontally, if preferable:\n\nbarplot(props, xlim = c(0, .4),\n  width = .2, col = c(\"blue\", \"white\", \"red\"),\n  horiz = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we adjusted the range of the x-axis now instead of the y-axis.\n\n\nHistograms\nA bar chart is slightly different from a histogram. We use bar charts to plot frequencies (or proportions) of values present in categories. Continuous data don’t have categories, so to make a similar plot we have to create “categories”. They are often called bins or cells and are created by delining ranges in which the frequencies are calculated. Thankfully, R will do this, and plot the histogram, when we call the function hist:\n\nhist(ToothGrowth$len)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in a histogram the sides of the cells touch, whereas they do not in a bar chart. We can also plot the proportions, now called “density”, by changing a single parameter:\n\nhist(ToothGrowth$len, freq = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next graph we plot the histogram with a different bin width by specifying where to make the breakpoints between the bars:\n\nhist(ToothGrowth$len, freq = FALSE, breaks = seq(0, 35, 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote how the granularity of the plot changes with the width of the bin. We can also change the breaks by delining the number of cells to use:\n\nhist(ToothGrowth$len, freq = FALSE, breaks = 25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same parameters that change the axes and labels are applicable here:\n\nhist(ToothGrowth$len, freq = FALSE, breaks = seq(0, 35, 2),\n  main = \"Histogram of Tooth Growth\", xlab = \"Tooth Length\",\n  ylim = c(0, .07), col = \"orange\")",

Since we can save our code and not our mouse clicks, the use of these functions avoids any confusion about how an image was written, allows for quick simple changes, and provides a convenient way to reproduce multiple, similar plots.

This means that we cannot use these variables in ggplot to visualize, for instance, the difference between the number of deaths in men and women in a certain year. We can use some more advanced R data reshaping to get these data sets in the right shape.\n\n\n  Deaths Year Month    Sex\n1    901 1974   Jan female\n2    689 1974   Feb female\n3    827 1974   Mar female\n4    677 1974   Apr female\n5    522 1974   May female\n6    406 1974   Jun female\n\n\n\nggplot(data, aes(x=Month, y=Deaths, color=Sex)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is much more easy to keep in mind that any variable that you want to use as a part of your ggplot should get its own column when you are designing your data set (in Excel).

As we saw in the plot of the ldeaths data we start with indicating what data.frame to plot and use aes() to indicate what to plot on the x axis, the y axis and what to use as color. We do not have to indicate what to plot where and which color to give to which category. We simply map a column of our data.frame to an aesthetic. Depending on the geom we use there are a number of aesthetics that can be mapped to a variable:\n\nx\ny\ncolor\nfill\nsize\nalpha\nlinetype\nlabels\nshape\ngroup\n\nAesthetics can also be specified per geom layer. This allows plotting multiple geom layers with different aesthetics. However, when using one data source and one geom layer this will result in exactly the same plot.\n\nggplot(data) + geom_point(aes(x=Month, y=Deaths, color=Sex))\n\nWe can also use plotting parameters without mapping them to a variable to change all dots in the geom_point.

There are over thirty different geoms in ggplot which can be found at http://docs.ggplot2.org/. We will have a look at the plot types that we have already encountered using the basic R plotting functions and replace them with their ggplot counterparts.\n\nScatter plots\nJust like with other objects in R a ggplot object can be saved to a variable using “&lt;-”. This makes it possible to store the basic plot in a variable and add different geoms to it. Geometries are added to a plot using “+”.\n\n#Basic graphics:\nplot(ToothGrowth$len)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(ToothGrowth)\np + geom_point(aes(x=as.numeric(rownames(ToothGrowth)), y=len), size=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now map the numeric row names of ToothGrowth to the x aesthetic, however, we could also create a new column called index in the data.frame.\n\nToothGrowth$index &lt;- as.numeric(rownames(ToothGrowth))\n\nWhen we change the data of the ggplot object we saved in variable p we need to recreate the ggplot object with the new data set.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(ToothGrowth)\n\n\n\nLine graphs\n\n#Basic graphics:\nplot(ToothGrowth$len, type = \"l\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np + geom_line(aes(x=index, y=len))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar charts\n\n#Basic graphics:\nbarplot(table(ToothGrowth$dose))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np + geom_bar(aes(x=dose))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause dose is a continuous variable, ggplot creates a x axis with a continuous scale, which is why there is an empty spot for the 1.5 dose. If we want to use a continuous value as a categorical value we can change it into a factor on the fly in the geom function:\n\np + geom_bar(aes(x=as.factor(dose)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms\n\n#Basic graphics:\nhist(ToothGrowth$len,breaks = 50)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np + geom_histogram(aes(x=len), binwidth = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBox plots\n\n#Basic graphics:\nboxplot(ToothGrowth$len~ToothGrowth$supp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np + geom_boxplot(aes(x=supp,y=len))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want whiskers in our plot we can add an error bar geom\n\np + geom_errorbar(aes(x=supp, ymin=..., ymax=...),width=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as you can see, this geom requires ymin and ymax as aesthetics and does not calculate the values by itself. We could calculate the min and max values for tooth length grouped by supplement, but we will use a trick using ggplot’s box plot statistics function. (if you want to know more, please read more about these “stat” functions online)\nFirst, we add the error bars with the “stat_boxplot” function, and then add the box plots on top of them.\n\np + stat_boxplot(aes(x=supp,y=len), geom=\"errorbar\", width=0.5) + \n    geom_boxplot(aes(x=supp,y=len))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see the aesthetics of both geoms have to be defined separately in this plot. To reduce typing we could also write the ggplot as follows.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=supp,y=len)) \np + stat_boxplot(geom=\"errorbar\", width=0.5) + geom_boxplot()\n\nWhen the aesthetics are specified in the base ggplot object it is not necessary to specify them in the added layers.\n\n\nHeatmaps\nOne popular way of displaying large grids of data is using a heatmap. The tile geom generates a tile at each provided x and y value and uses the fill aesthetic to fill the tiles according to another variable. The border color of the tiles are can be changed by using the color aesthetic.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(ToothGrowth)\n\np + geom_tile(aes(x = supp, y = as.factor(dose), fill = len), color=\"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are dedicated packages for plotting heatmaps, which also perform horizontal and vertical clustering of the tiles.

However, after specifying how many plots should be printed in the plot viewer we have to call the plot function multiple times to populate the viewer.\nIf we want to compare the effect of orange juice versus vitamin C depending on the dose we can plot three box plots next to each other.\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 3))\n\nlow &lt;- ToothGrowth[which(ToothGrowth$dose==0.5),]\nmed &lt;- ToothGrowth[which(ToothGrowth$dose==1),]\nhigh &lt;- ToothGrowth[which(ToothGrowth$dose==2),]\n\nboxplot(low$len~low$supp, main = \"Low dose\", xlab = \"Supplement Type\")\nboxplot(med$len~med$supp, main = \"Medium dose\", xlab = \"Supplement Type\")\nboxplot(high$len~high$supp, main = \"High dose\", xlab = \"Supplement Type\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, using ggplot we can simply map the dose column to a ggplot facet grid. The mapping of variables is not done via a aes(), but in formula form. Variables on the right indicate the columns in the grid and variables on the left indicate the rows of the grid. A “.” can be used if we want to use only one variable for faceting. This will also preserve the scales, making it more easy to compare the three plots. For fun, let’s add the actual data points in an additional geom on top of the box plot.\n\nggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=supp,y=len)) + \n    stat_boxplot(geom=\"errorbar\", width=0.5) + \n    geom_boxplot() + geom_point(color=\"red\") + \n    facet_grid(. ~ as.factor(dose))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can do the same with two variables in a grid.\n\nggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=len)) + \n    geom_histogram(bins = 5) + \n    facet_grid(dose ~ as.factor(supp))",

    "text": "Making selections in a list\nTo make selections in a list, we can use single square brackets, double square brackets and the dollar sign. The use of single square brackets works in the same way as it does for vectors.\n\nmylist &lt;- list(\n  foo=c(1,2, 3),\n  bar=c('a', 'b'),\n  baz=list(TRUE, c(2, 4))\n  )\nmylist[c(1,3)]\n\n$foo\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n$baz\n$baz[[1]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n$baz[[2]]\n[1] 2 4\n\nmylist[c(1,2,3)==2]\n\n$bar\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\nmylist['bar']\n\n$bar\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\n\nWe can also use double square brackets and the dollar sign for a list. There are two important differences between using single and double square brackets: 1. Using double square brackets only allows us to select a single element from the list. 2. The result of a selection with double brackets is the element itself, while if we make the selection with single brackets the result is a list consisting of the selected elements.\n\nmylist[[1]]\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\n\nmode(mylist[[1]]) # a vector\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nmode(mylist[1])   # a list with with a numeric vector as its single element   \n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nThere is another way to select a variable from a list which is by using the dollar sign (‘$’). This is an alternative to using double square brackets in combination with a name. When we use this the result is always a vector.\n\nmylist$foo      # results is a vector\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nInstead of using the dollar sign we can use double square brackets. We now need to put the name between quotes like for single square brackets. We can also use the position of the variable using these double square brackets.\n\nmydata &lt;- data.frame(id=c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n                     sex=factor(c('M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'F')),\n                     weight=c(77, 44, 56, 88, 49),\n                     treatm=c('A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A'))\nmydata[['treatm']]\n\n[1] \"A\" \"A\" \"B\" \"B\" \"A\"\n\nmydata[[1]]\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nIt is not possible to select more than one element using double brackets; The result will always be a vector (instead of a data.frame)",

    "text": "Selecting observations and variables in a data.frame\nSelecting observations and variables in a data.frame works more or less the same for data.frames as it does for lists. However because a data.frame is two dimensional we can two indices between the square brackets. The first one corresponds to the observations (rows) and the second corresponds to the variables (columns). So, as an example, we can select the first two observations from the third variable in the data.frame using the syntax:\n\nmydata &lt;- data.frame(id=c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n                     sex=factor(c('M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'F')),\n                     weight=c(77, 44, 56, 88, 49))\nmydata[c(1, 2), 3]\n\n[1] 77 44\n\n\nWhen the first or second position is left blank all rows or columns are selected. For example:\n\nmydata[, 3]       # sex (3rd variable) for all patients\n\n[1] 77 44 56 88 49\n\nmydata[c(1,2), ]  # all variables for the first two patients\n\n  id sex weight\n1  1   M     77\n2  2   F     44\n\nmydata[c(-3,-4), 'sex'] # Negative numbers and names can also be used\n\n[1] M F F\nLevels: F M\n\n\nWe have to be careful when we want to select a single variable from a data.frame, as we do above. The result will now no longer be a data.frame but it is transformed to a vector. When we want to prevent this we can use drop=FALSE, as follows:\n\nmydata[ , 3]\n\n[1] 77 44 56 88 49\n\nmydata[ , 3, drop=FALSE]       \n\n  weight\n1     77\n2     44\n3     56\n4     88\n5     49\n\n\nWe can also use a single index between the square brackets. This works as if the data.frame was a list of variables (it’s columns).\n\nmydata[1]\n\n  id\n1  1\n2  2\n3  3\n4  4\n5  5\n\nmydata[[1]]\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nA data.frame has row.names (note the dot) as well as variable names we can use for selection. Let’s look at an example where row names are gene symbols and column names are sample IDs:\n\nmygenes &lt;- data.frame(samp1 = c(33, 22, 12), \n                      samp2 = c(44, 111, 13), \n                      samp3 = c(33, 53, 65))\nrow.names(mygenes) &lt;- c(\"CRP\", \"BRCA1\", \"HOXA\")\nnames(mygenes)\n\n[1] \"samp1\" \"samp2\" \"samp3\"\n\nmygenes\n\n      samp1 samp2 samp3\nCRP      33    44    33\nBRCA1    22   111    53\nHOXA     12    13    65\n\nmygenes[\"CRP\", ]\n\n    samp1 samp2 samp3\nCRP    33    44    33\n\nmygenes[, \"samp1\"]\n\n[1] 33 22 12\n\nmygenes[, c(\"samp1\", \"samp3\")]\n\n      samp1 samp3\nCRP      33    33\nBRCA1    22    53\nHOXA     12    65\n\nmygenes[\"HOXA\", \"samp2\"]\n\n[1] 13\n\n\n\nOther useful functions\nBesides square brackets ([, [[), other useful functions exist for selecting data: duplicated, match, %in%, grep, is.na and $.\nTo select e.g. rows that are not duplicated:\n\nmm &lt;- matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 2), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)\n\n\nmm\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]    1\n[2,]    1\n[3,]    2\n[4,]    2\n\nmm[!duplicated(mm), ]\n\n[1] 1 2\n\n\nThe above can also be done with unique, but the use of duplicated might be more appropriate in more complex situations:\n\nunique(mm)\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]    1\n[2,]    2\n\n\nCalling match returns the position of the first match of its first argument in the second argument:\n\nmatch(c(\"a\", \"b\"), c(\"a\", \"c\", \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"b\"))\n\n[1] 1 4\n\n\nwhereas \\%in\\% tells you whether the elements of the first argument appear in the second argument:\n\nc(\"a\", \"b\", \"d\") %in% c(\"a\", \"c\", \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"b\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nRecall our data frame mygenes:\n\nmygenes\n\n      samp1 samp2 samp3\nCRP      33    44    33\nBRCA1    22   111    53\nHOXA     12    13    65\n\nis.data.frame(mygenes)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nNote that since mygenes is a data frame, it is therefore also an array, which means we can select by the name of the elements in the array:\n\nmygenes[match(c(\"samp1\", \"samp3\"), colnames(mygenes))]\n\n      samp1 samp3\nCRP      33    33\nBRCA1    22    53\nHOXA     12    65\n\nmygenes[colnames(mygenes) %in% c(\"samp1\", \"samp4\")]\n\n      samp1\nCRP      33\nBRCA1    22\nHOXA     12\n\n\nHowever, in this case we could just use the names…\n\nmygenes[c(\"samp1\", \"samp3\")]\n\n      samp1 samp3\nCRP      33    33\nBRCA1    22    53\nHOXA     12    65\n\n\nBut this gives an error:\n\nmygenes[c(\"samp1\", \"samp30\")] ## not run\n\nwhere this does not:\n\nmygenes[colnames(mygenes) %in% c(\"samp1\", \"samp30\")]\n\n      samp1\nCRP      33\nBRCA1    22\nHOXA     12\n\n\nWe can also use functions like grep to search for the names we are interested in:\n\nmygenes[grep(2, names(mygenes))]\n\n      samp2\nCRP      44\nBRCA1   111\nHOXA     13\n\nmygenes[grep(\"A\", row.names(mygenes)), ]\n\n      samp1 samp2 samp3\nBRCA1    22   111    53\nHOXA     12    13    65\n\n\nIf we want to find or exclude data with missing values, we can use is.na:\n\nz &lt;- c(1:4, NA, 5:10)\nz\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4 NA  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nis.na(z)\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\nwhich(is.na(z))\n\n[1] 5\n\nz[!is.na(z)]\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10",

    "text": "Hypothesis testing and Confidence Intervals\nComparison is the most common basic principle in medical research. A statement about the truth is compared against a reference statement (the null).\nThe p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed data in the sample (or some- thing more extreme than the observed data), given that the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is calculated based on a point estimate (e.g. mean) of the sample. The decision to reject a null hypothesis based on the p-value depends on a chosen \\(\\alpha\\) level.\nFor a given dataset and corresponding test statistic, we say the results of the test are “statistically significant” if the p-value is less than the pre-selected and fixed significance level, \\(\\alpha\\) (often 0.05).\nNote that there is a distinction between statistical significance and clinical relevance:\nA confidence interval (CI) is another way to show the reliability of a point estimate. The decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis aligns with whether or not the CI contains the null value (e.g. \\(H_0\\): mean = 0; if CI does not contain 0 then reject, otherwise do not reject \\(H_0\\)). In other words, the decision made by comparing the test statistic’s p-value to \\(\\alpha\\) will be the same as a decision made using a \\((1 - \\alpha) * 100\\%\\) CI. An interpretation of e.g. a 95% CI is “if the testing procedure were repeated on many (k) samples, the confidence intervals would encompass the true population parameter in 95% of the k samples” or, more abstractly, “we are 95% confident that the true [e.g. mean] lies in the confidence interval”.",

The samples should come from normal distributions (can check using e.g. qqnorm()) and the variances from each population are assumed to be equal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe t-test in R makes a correction that does not require equal variances of the two populations. The null hypothesis is that the difference between means is 0; the alternative is that this difference is not 0.\nHere is an example of how to do this test in R. In a data set on tooth growth, it appears that OJ recipients in the sample had a larger tooth growth than VC recipients, on average. We can test if this is true in the larger population using a t-test. Let’s set \\(H_0\\) to be that the two mean tooth lengths are the same and \\(H_a\\) will be that the two mean tooth lengths are not equal. Let’s use a 0.10 significance level, which means the probability we falsely reject the null is 0.10. Note that the function t.test also provides a confidence interval - the confidence level specified should be \\(1 - \\alpha\\) for the interpretations to align.\n\ndata(\"ToothGrowth\")\n\nttooth &lt;- t.test(ToothGrowth$len~ToothGrowth$supp, conf.level = 0.90)\nttooth\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  ToothGrowth$len by ToothGrowth$supp\nt = 1.9153, df = 55.309, p-value = 0.06063\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group OJ and group VC is not equal to 0\n90 percent confidence interval:\n 0.4682687 6.9317313\nsample estimates:\nmean in group OJ mean in group VC \n        20.66333         16.96333 \n\n\nHere the p-value is less than our chosen significance level so we reject the null. Therefore, at the 10% significance level, the data provide sufficient evidence that our alternative hypothesis, that there is a difference between using OJ and VC to grow teeth, is true.\nNow consider the following example. Suppose we believe the mean reaction velocity in an enzymatic reaction will be higher in cells treated with Puromycin compared to cells not treated with Puromycin. Let’s use the 0.05 significance level, allowing for a slightly smaller Type I error probability than in the previous example.\n\ndata(\"Puromycin\")\n\nt.test(rate ~ state, data = Puromycin, alternative = \"greater\")\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  rate by state\nt = 1.6375, df = 19.578, p-value = 0.05875\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group treated and group untreated is greater than 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -1.677431       Inf\nsample estimates:\n  mean in group treated mean in group untreated \n               141.5833                110.7273 \n\n\nHere our p-value is greater than \\(\\alpha\\) so we do not reject the null hypothesis. We therefore conclude that, at the 5% significance level, the data do not provide sufficient evidence that Puromycin increases the mean reaction velocity.\nWe can extract statistics from the output:\n\nmytest &lt;- t.test(rate~state, data = Puromycin, alternative = \"greater\")\nmytest$p.value\n\n[1] 0.05874922\n\nmytest$conf.int\n\n[1] -1.677431       Inf\nattr(,\"conf.level\")\n[1] 0.95\n\n\nCan you guess why the CI goes to Inf (infinity)?\nIf samples are matched or paired (e.g. before/after), use argument paired=TRUE.\n\n\nMann-Whitney U Test\nThe Mann-Whitney U test (also known as the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test) is a non- parametric test for a location shift between two independent populations without assuming normality. However, the values should be sampled from two populations with very similar distributions. The null hypothesis is that there is no shift in the centers of the distributions of the two populations; the alternative is that there is a shift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwtest &lt;- wilcox.test(rate~state, data = Puromycin, conf.int = TRUE)\nwtest\n\n\n    Wilcoxon rank sum exact test\n\ndata:  rate by state\nW = 88, p-value = 0.1896\nalternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -10  75\nsample estimates:\ndifference in location \n                    36 \n\nwtest$p.value\n\n[1] 0.1895867\n\n\nThe test statistic W in R is defined to be the sum of the ranks of one of the groups minus \\(n_1(n_1 +1)/2\\). The procedure to obtain a confidence interval is quite involved, but thankfully R will provide it to us upon request.\n\n\nANOVA\nA two-sample t-test is used to test hypotheses about the means of two normal populations using two datasets which were sampled independently of one another from the two respective populations. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) allows for comparing the means of one variable among more than two populations (each of which is normally distributed), again under the assumption that the samples are independent.\n\nIf the variance between groups is higher than the variance within groups, then there is evidence for a difference in means between groups.\nThe null hypothesis is that the means of all groups are equal; the alternative is that at least one group has a different mean from the others.\nANOVA does not provide which group is different nor in what direction; visualization and/or post-hoc pairwise t-tests can provide this information.\n\nHere is a small illustration of the analysis of variance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the left image there is more variability within each of the three groups (boxplots) than between the three group means (\\(\\bar{x}_1\\), \\(\\bar{x}_2\\), \\(\\bar{x}_3\\)). In the right image there is more variability between the three group means than within each of the three groups..\nAs with the previous testing procedures we’ve seen, we compare the p-value to the pre-selected significance level. If \\(p \\leq \\alpha\\) we reject the null and conclude we have evidence that at least one population (or group) mean is different from the others, while if \\(p &gt; \\alpha\\), we fail to reject the null and conclude we do not have evidence that any of the means are different.\nR will calculate all of the statistics for us! For example, let’s test at the 5% significance level the alternative hypothesis that at least one of the mean BMIs for three different educational levels are different from the other two (versus the null of three equal means).\n\nlibrary(readr)\nR_data &lt;- read_csv(\"~/R_data2.csv\")\n\n\nbaby_aov1 &lt;- aov(BMI ~ educational_level, data = R_data)\nsummary(baby_aov1)\n\n                   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)  \neducational_level   2   63.8   31.90   3.409 0.0351 *\nResiduals         187 1749.8    9.36                 \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nHere the F-statistic is large enough to get a p-value smaller than 0.05 so we conclude at least one population mean BMI is different from the other two. But which group is it? Let’s look at a boxplot:\n\nboxplot(R_data$BMI ~ R_data$educational_level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visual information is informative but we can actually make pairwise comparisons of all the means using Tukey’s HSD (for example). We initially used a significance level of 0.05, but will now conduct several tests and use a multiple test procedure that adjusts the family-wise error rate to 5%:\n\nTukeyHSD(baby_aov1)\n\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = BMI ~ educational_level, data = R_data)\n\n$educational_level\n                       diff         lwr      upr     p adj\nintermediate-high 1.1397600 -0.07099027 2.350510 0.0697761\nlow-high          1.3587302 -0.05180238 2.769263 0.0617385\nlow-intermediate  0.2189702 -1.12174472 1.559685 0.9212512\n\n\nNote that we use the multiple testing procedure to account for the fact that we are simultaneously performing more than one test or CI which compounds the error rates of each test. Since all of the CIs contain 0 and none of the p-values are significant at the 5% level, the initial test result is overturned! We do not actually have evidence that education level affects average BMI.\nAlso note you would not bother with these posthoc tests/CIs if your initial ANOVA results were not statistically significant.\n\n\nKruskal-Wallis Test\nThe single-factor ANOVA model for comparing population or treatment means assumed that for all groups, random samples were drawn from normal populations each having the same variance. This normality assumption is required for a valid F test, but the next procedure for testing the equality of the centers of the distributions only requires that the populations have the same continuous distribution.\nThe null hypothesis is that all of the group centers are the same and the alternative is that at least one of the group centers is different. The Kruskal-Wallis test examines the validity of these hypotheses by working on ranks of the data without assuming the data come from a specific distribution.\nThe procedure starts by ranking all the data together on the assumption of the null, that if the centers of the groups are equal, the ranks from all the groups will be intermingled. If the null is false, then some samples will consist mostly of observations having small ranks in the combined sample, whereas others will consist mostly of observations having large ranks.\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test statistic is a measure of the extent to which the sums of the ranks within each group deviate from their common expected value, and the null is rejected if the computed value of the statistic indicates too great a discrepancy between observed and expected rank averages.\nExample. The accompanying observations on axial stiffness index resulted from a study of metal-plate connected trusses in which five different plate lengths (4 in., 6 in., 8 in., 10 in., and 12 in.) were used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we read in the data:\n\nlibrary(readr)\nstiffness &lt;- read_csv(\"~/stiffness.csv\")\n\nIf we look at the boxplot of the stiffness values for each length, we see that the means are probably different and that the boxplots don’t look very normal:\n\nboxplot(stiffness~lengths, data = stiffness)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output of the Kruskal-Wallis test confirms that the means are indeed different. The p-value is quite small, indicating at least two of the group centers are different:\n\nkruskal.test(stiffness~lengths, data = stiffness)\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  stiffness by lengths\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 20.122, df = 4, p-value = 0.0004724\n\n\n\n\nChi-squared test\nA \\(\\chi^2\\) (read: chi-squared) test of independence tests the null hypothesis that rows and columns are independent in a c x r contingency table (r is number of rows, c columns); the alternative is that they are not independent. The counts must be independent and sampled randomly. We can calculate a chi-squared statistic as follows:\n\\(\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i}\\)\nwhere \\(O_i\\) is the observed count for cell i in the table, and \\(E_i\\) is the expected count, calculated by multiplying the row and column totals for i divided by the overall total. The p-value for the calculated \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic depends on the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with \\((r -1)*(c-1)\\) degrees of freedom. R will provide us with the statistic and p-value.\nSuppose we have the following table:\n\n\n\n\nevent\nno event\ntotal\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\n20\n80\n100\n\n\nplacebo\n50\n50\n100\n\n\ntotal\n70\n130\n200\n\n\n\nand we want to know whether our treatment prevents events, that is, does the occurence of an event depend on the type of treatment?\n\nmytable &lt;- matrix(c(20, 50, 80, 50), nrow=2)\nmytable\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]   20   80\n[2,]   50   50\n\ncstest &lt;- chisq.test(mytable)\ncstest\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  mytable\nX-squared = 18.484, df = 1, p-value = 1.714e-05\n\ncstest$p.value\n\n[1] 1.713801e-05\n\n\n\n\nCorrelations\nIf we want to know the degree of a linear association between 2 variables, we can calculate correlation. Correlation does not make any a priori assumptions about whether one variable is dependent on the other and is not concerned with the relationship between the variables. We have 4 general types of association to consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearson’s r can only lie in the interval [-1,1] (inclusive), where\n\nr = 0, no linear correlation\nr &gt; 0, positive linear correlation\nr &lt; 0, negative linear correlation\nr = 1, perfect positive linear correlation\nr = -1, perfect negative linear correlation\n\nNote that correlation does not imply causation. If two variables are highly correlated you cannot infer that one is causing the other; they could both be varying along with a third, possibly unknown confounding factor (either causal or not).\nFor Pearson’s r we assume a linear relationship between x and y and that they both follow a normal distribution.\nIf data are not normally distributed, the degree of association can be determined by the ranked correlation coefficient, Spearman’s \\(\\rho\\), which replaces the x’s and y’s in the Pearson formula with their ranks.\nR provides p-values and confidence intervals for both Pearson and Spearman correlations.\nLet’s look at an example of how BMI and cholesterol are associated:\n\nplot(R_data$BMI,  R_data$cholesterol)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncor(R_data$BMI,  R_data$cholesterol)\n\n[1] 0.2004703\n\ncor(R_data$BMI,  R_data$cholesterol, method=\"spearman\")\n\n[1] 0.1876358\n\ncor.test(R_data$BMI,  R_data$cholesterol)\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  R_data$BMI and R_data$cholesterol\nt = 2.8057, df = 188, p-value = 0.00555\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.05982424 0.33331173\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.2004703 \n\ncor.test(R_data$BMI,  R_data$cholesterol, method=\"spearman\")\n\nWarning in cor.test.default(R_data$BMI, R_data$cholesterol, method =\n\"spearman\"): Cannot compute exact p-value with ties\n\n\n\n    Spearman's rank correlation rho\n\ndata:  R_data$BMI and R_data$cholesterol\nS = 928642, p-value = 0.009531\nalternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0\nsample estimates:\n      rho \n0.1876358 \n\n\nNote the warning message (which is not an error!) that indicates if your data have tied values (e.g. 1, 1, 3, 5) then the p-value is approximated and is not exact.

    "text": "Regression\n\nLinear regression\nThere is a high positive correlation between birth weight and gestational age, but this says nothing about predictive power of the variables. We would like to explain how gestational age influences changes in birth weight.\n\nplot(R_data$pregnancy_length_weeks, R_data$birthweight)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncor(R_data$pregnancy_length_weeks, R_data$birthweight)\n\n[1] 0.9785784\n\n\nWe’ll quantify this relationship using linear regression, distinguishing between an in- dependent, or predictor or explanatory, variable (gestational age) and a dependent, or response or outcome, variable (birth weight). Simple linear regression uses the following model:\n\\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_i + \\varepsilon_i\\)\nwhere \\(1 \\leq i \\leq n\\), the model is a straight line, and error is remaining variation which cannot be explained by the model. The parameters \\(beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are the intercept and slope of a straight line, respectively.\nThe \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) of the one straight line that best fits the data is estimated via the method of least squares. The “best” line is the one that has the lowest sum of squared residuals. The command to get these estimates in R is lm:\n\nlm1 &lt;- lm(birthweight ~ pregnancy_length_weeks, data = R_data)\nlm1\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = birthweight ~ pregnancy_length_weeks, data = R_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n           (Intercept)  pregnancy_length_weeks  \n              -12441.4                   400.3  \n\n\nYou can predict for given values\n\npredict(lm1)[R_data$pregnancy_length_weeks==35]\n\n      12       73      141 \n1568.921 1568.921 1568.921 \n\n\nYou can also use predict() to predict y for x’s that are not already in your data:\n\npredict(lm1, newdata=data.frame(pregnancy_length_weeks=c(seq(25,50,5))))\n\n         1          2          3          4          5          6 \n-2434.0284  -432.5538  1568.9207  3570.3952  5571.8698  7573.3443 \n\n\nbut watch out for extrapolating (predicting outside the range of your data) - clearly we can’t have negative birth weights!\nNow, before we make inference on or, actually, even find and use this line, we must check that the following assumptions hold, otherwise we will not obtain trustworthy results: - relationship between x and y can be described by a straight line - outcomes y are independent - variance of residuals is constant across values of x - residuals follow a normal distribution\nTo get diagnostic plots in R, we can check a histogram of the data and additionally plot our model to check that the residuals are normal and homoscedastic (have constant variance) across the weeks:\n\nhist(R_data$birthweight)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(lm1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top left plot tells us if our residuals are homoscedastic, and the top right plot displays a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot to check for normality. Here are examples of bad QQ plots and heteroscedasticity:\n\nset.seed(1234)\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nx &lt;- sort(rnorm(100))\ny1 &lt;- sort(rt(100,2))\nplot(x, y1, xlim=c(-3,3), xlab=\"normal\", ylab=\"t, df=2\")\nabline(0, 1)\ny2 &lt;- sort(rexp(100))\nplot(x, y2, xlim=c(-3,3), ylim=c(-6,6), xlab=\"normal\", ylab=\"exponential\")\nabline(0, 1)\nplot(x, x^2-5+rexp(100))\nabline(0, 0, col=\"red\")\nplot(x, x*rexp(100))\nabline(0, 0, col=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the assumptions reasonably hold for our baby data, so we’ll go ahead and use the model fit to make inference on the slope.\nActually, R has already done the inference…we just need to extract it from the model:\n\nsummary(lm1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = birthweight ~ pregnancy_length_weeks, data = R_data)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-280.1 -106.7   -2.9  101.2  331.4 \n\nCoefficients:\n                         Estimate Std.

The probabilities are quite small, so we can reject the null hypothesis that they are equal to 0 and conclude that birthweight significantly increases, on average, by 400 grams per every additional week of gestation. The intercept is (usually) unimportant and we don’t really care that it is different from 0. If the p-value for the slope is not small (e.g. greater than 0.05) then we would say “we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the slope is 0.”\nNow, how good does the model actually fit our data? How well does x predict y? The square of Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r, is a measure of goodness of fit. It is the proportion of variance in y that can be explained by the model (so, x). In our example, r2 is:\n\ncor(R_data$pregnancy_length_weeks, R_data$birthweight)^2\n\n[1] 0.9576157\n\nsummary(lm1)$r.squared\n\n[1] 0.9576157\n\n\nwhich means that 96% of the variability in birth weight can be explained by gestational age.\nSimple linear regression models one y on one x. If we have multiple predictor variables, we use multiple linear regression to determine if the variability in y can be explained by this set of variables. In addition to the assumptions required for a valid simple linear regression, we now include that the covariates have no perfect multicollinearity, that is there is no strong correlation between the multiple x’s. The model is\n\\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*X_{1i} + ... + \\beta_k*X_{ki}+\\varepsilon_i\\)\nIn R, the addition of an extra variable is quite straightforward:\n\ncor(R_data$pregnancy_length_weeks, R_data$BMI)\n\n[1] 0.01068054\n\nlm2 &lt;- lm(birthweight ~ pregnancy_length_weeks + BMI, data = R_data)\nlm2stats &lt;- summary(lm2)\nlm2stats\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = birthweight ~ pregnancy_length_weeks + BMI, data = R_data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-279.39 -105.78   -1.85  105.25  333.50 \n\nCoefficients:\n                         Estimate Std.

We see that it does not significantly predict birth weight, but gestational age still does. We use the adjusted \\(r^2\\) to check goodness of fit:\n\nlm2stats$adj.r.squared\n\n[1] 0.9573304\n\n\nSo adding BMI does not help explain any of the variability in birth weight (since r2 was previously already 0.96). This is also confirmed by visualization:\n\nplot(R_data$BMI, R_data$birthweight)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the summary function returns a lot of information. If, for example, you wanted to extract only the p-values you could do the following:\n\nnames(lm2stats)\n\n [1] \"call\"          \"terms\"         \"residuals\"     \"coefficients\" \n [5] \"aliased\"       \"sigma\"         \"df\"            \"r.squared\"    \n [9] \"adj.r.squared\" \"fstatistic\"    \"cov.unscaled\" \n\nlm2stats$coef[,4]\n\n           (Intercept) pregnancy_length_weeks                    BMI \n         2.179929e-108          1.815592e-130           3.918778e-01 \n\n\nWe can predict birthweights with new data:\n\npredict(lm2, newdata=data.frame(pregnancy_length_weeks=32,\nBMI=30))\n\n      1 \n351.771 \n\n\nBut we cannot forget to check assumptions!\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(lm2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\nhist(lm2$residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogistic regression\nThere are many research topics for with the dependent variable y is binary (0/1), e.g.\n\nmortality (dead/alive)\ntreatment response (responder/non-responder)\ndevelopment of disease (yes/no)\n\nand we want to predict the membership of an individual to one of the two categories based on a set of predictors.\nIn this situation we have to work with probabilities, which are numbers between 0 and 1. A value \\(P(y)\\) that is close to 0 means that y is very unlikely to occur, while a value close to 1 means that y is very likely to occur.\nIn simple/multiple linear regression a continuous variable y is predicted by continuous/categorical x(s), but if y can only have 2 values (e.g. y = 0 or y = 1), how do we predict the probability that y = 1 given one or more predictors? Could we apply a linear regression model…?\nwe would try to fit \\(P(y = 1) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X\\), which doesn’t work. In linear regression we assume the relationship between x and y is linear, but in the case of binary outcomes this assumption is no longer valid. Results obtained from a linear regression model wouldn’t makes sense! Probabilities beyond the interval (0,1) are not interpretable.\nInstead we’re going to use a logistic curve:\n\\(ln(\\frac{p}{1-p}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X\\)\nThe function \\(ln(p/(1- p))\\) is called a logit of p and it is this function of y that is linear in x instead of y itself.\nThis model formulation assures that the predicted probability of an event falls between 0 and 1, unlike a linear regression model.\nAlso note that we’ve made no assumptions about linearity, normality or homoscedasticity! The values of the intercept and slope are estimated using the maximum likelihood method, which finds the values of the coefficients that make the observed data most likely to occur. Statistical significance of estimate coefficients is testing with the Wald test, which is based on the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution (though R calls it “z”). The goodness of fit is assessed by deviance, which is based on the differences observed-expected principle. Also, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) gives a measure of the quality of the model. The coefficients are most usefully interpreted with the following:\n\\(e^{\\beta} \\ \\frac{\\textrm{odds after a unit change}}{\\textrm{original odds}}\\)\nand when x is binary, \\(e^{\\beta}\\) is the odds ratio from the 2 by 2 contingency table!\nIn R:\n\nR_data$StatusNew &lt;- factor(R_data$Status, \n                           levels = c(\"normal brain development\", \"intellectual disability\"))\nlevels(R_data$StatusNew)\n\n[1] \"normal brain development\" \"intellectual disability\" \n\nlr1 &lt;- glm(StatusNew ~ BMI, family = binomial(logit), data = R_data)\nsummary(lr1)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = StatusNew ~ BMI, family = binomial(logit), data = R_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Suppose we have the data frame describing someone’s coin collection:\n\ncoins &lt;- data.frame(Coin = c(\"penny\", \"quarter\", \"nickel\", \"quarter\", \"dime\", \"penny\"),\n                    Year = c(1943, 1905, 1889, 1960, 1937, 1900),\n                    Mint = c(\"Den\", \"SF\", \"Phil\", \"Den\", \"SF\", \"Den\"),\n                    Condition = c(\"good\", \"fair\", \"excellent\", \"good\", \"poor\", \"good\"),\n                    Value = c(12.00, 55.00, 300.00, 40.00, 18.00, 28.00),\n                    Price = c(15.00, 45.00, 375.00, 25.00, 20.00, 20.00))\ncoins\n\n     Coin Year Mint Condition Value Price\n1   penny 1943  Den      good    12    15\n2 quarter 1905   SF      fair    55    45\n3  nickel 1889 Phil excellent   300   375\n4 quarter 1960  Den      good    40    25\n5    dime 1937   SF      poor    18    20\n6   penny 1900  Den      good    28    20\n\n\nIf we type:\n\ncolMeans(coins)\n\nError in colMeans(coins): 'x' must be numeric\n\n\nwe get an error message because some of the columns are non-numeric. We can compute the means of the numeric columns by looping over the columns, each time checking whether it’s numeric before computing it’s mean:\n\nmeans &lt;- NULL\nfor(i in 1:ncol(coins)) {\n  if (is.numeric(coins[ , i])) {\n    means &lt;- c(means, mean(coins[ , i]))\n  }\n}\n\nThe result is:\n\nmeans\n\n[1] 1922.33333   75.50000   83.33333",

The amount of time and code you will spend on data cleaning, can be a lot larger than the actual analysis.\nRemember that R solely works with syntax. This means that you cannot adjust data manually and you will always have code to reproduce your results.\nSo, if the source data file gets adjusted slightly - say new patients are added, or some measurements are corrected - you just run your code and all your data preparation steps are performed automatically!\nFirst of all we need to make sure data is in a tidy format.

This can be seen as an improved version of a data.frame object.\n\nhead(Orthodont_w)\n\nKey: &lt;Subject, Sex&gt;\n   Subject    Sex     8    10    12    14\n     &lt;ord&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt; &lt;num&gt;\n1:     M16   Male  22.0  21.5  23.5  25.0\n2:     M05   Male  20.0  23.5  22.5  26.0\n3:     M02   Male  21.5  22.5  23.0  26.5\n4:     M11   Male  23.0  23.0  23.5  25.0\n5:     M07   Male  22.0  22.0  24.5  26.5\n6:     M08   Male  24.0  21.5  24.5  25.5\n\n\nNotice how the variables age and distance have been replaced with their values.\nIf I start with a data set in wide format, but need to transform it to long format, I use the function melt() (also from data.table).\n\nOrthodont_L &lt;- melt(setDT(Orthodont_w), id = c(\"Subject\", \"Sex\"),\n                     measure =c(\"8\", \"10\", \"12\", \"14\"), \n                     value.name = \"distance\",\n                     variable.name = \"age\")\n\n\nid denotes the variables that are only measured once (at baseline)\nmeasure are the variables that you want to stack\nvalue.name will be the variable name for the repeatedly measured variable\nvariable.name will denote which measurement it is (age of patient)\n\n\n\nhead(Orthodont_L)\n\n   Subject    Sex    age distance\n     &lt;ord&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1:     M16   Male      8     22.0\n2:     M05   Male      8     20.0\n3:     M02   Male      8     21.5\n4:     M11   Male      8     23.0\n5:     M07   Male      8     22.0\n6:     M08   Male      8     24.0\n\n\nIt is possible to reshape with multiple repeated measurements. Here is an example of data where ferritin (FER) and creatinin (CREA) are measured twice.\n\n\n  ID FER1 CREA1 FER2 CREA2\n1  A   44  0.92  133  1.17\n2  B  293  1.02  258  1.45\n3  C  164  1.22   38  0.96\n4  D   90  0.85  149  1.04\n\n\nThe code below reshapes the data to long format\n\ndw.long &lt;- melt(setDT(dw), id = \"ID\",\n        measure=list(c(\"FER1\", \"FER2\"), c(\"CREA1\", \"CREA2\")), \n        value.name=c('FER', 'CREA'),\n        variable.name = \"Time\")\n\ndw.long\n\n       ID   Time   FER  CREA\n   &lt;char&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;num&gt;\n1:      A      1    44  0.92\n2:      B      1   293  1.02\n3:      C      1   164  1.22\n4:      D      1    90  0.85\n5:      A      2   133  1.17\n6:      B      2   258  1.45\n7:      C      2    38  0.96\n8:      D      2   149  1.04\n\n\nThe function patterns can be used if my repeatedly measured variables are measured with high frequency. By using patterns(\"age\"), all variables with age are stacked.\n\n\nKey: &lt;Subject, Sex&gt;\n   Subject    Sex age_8 age_10 age_12 age_14\n     &lt;ord&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;num&gt;  &lt;num&gt;  &lt;num&gt;  &lt;num&gt;\n1:     M16   Male  22.0   21.5   23.5   25.0\n2:     M05   Male  20.0   23.5   22.5   26.0\n3:     M02   Male  21.5   22.5   23.0   26.5\n4:     M11   Male  23.0   23.0   23.5   25.0\n5:     M07   Male  22.0   22.0   24.5   26.5\n6:     M08   Male  24.0   21.5   24.5   25.5\n\n\n\ndw.long &lt;- melt(setDT(Orthodont_w), id = c(\"Subject\", \"Sex\"),\n        measure = patterns(\"age\"), \n        value.name = \"distance\",\n        variable.name = \"age\")\n\n\nhead(dw.long, 10)\n\n    Subject    Sex    age distance\n      &lt;ord&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n 1:     M16   Male  age_8     22.0\n 2:     M05   Male  age_8     20.0\n 3:     M02   Male  age_8     21.5\n 4:     M11   Male  age_8     23.0\n 5:     M07   Male  age_8     22.0\n 6:     M08   Male  age_8     24.0\n 7:     M03   Male  age_8     23.0\n 8:     M12   Male  age_8     21.5\n 9:     M13   Male  age_8     17.0\n10:     M14   Male  age_8     22.5\n\n\n\n\nMerge data sets\nData sets can be combined in different ways.\n\nAdd new observations (same variables)\nAdd new variables (same observations)\nComplex combining\n\nLet us simulate a few separate data sets.

Be very careful that your observations are in the exact same order. The function cbind does not match, but simply pastes variables to your data set.\n\n\n\n\nComplex merging\nSometimes combining data sets is more complicated. In data1 and data2 examples below, there are differences in variables, but also cases. They can be merged in four different ways. Think beforehand which way is desirable for your analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe corresponding code to the four ways is:\n\ndata_inner &lt;- merge(data1, data2, by = \"ID\")                 # Inner join\ndata_left  &lt;- merge(data1, data2, by = \"ID\", all.x = TRUE)   # Left join\ndata_right &lt;- merge(data1, data2, by = \"ID\", all.y = TRUE)   # Right join\ndata_full  &lt;- merge(data1, data2, by = \"ID\", all = TRUE)     # Full join\n\nSay, we have to repeat the previous merging: we have the data data_baseline with our 20 observations and baseline covariates. The end point is in a separate data set (df_4), but now it does not include the same set of observations (some IDs are missing and others are extra).\n\ndata_baseline\n\n   ID   Center BMI CRP\n1   1 Center 1  24  84\n2   2 Center 1  24  71\n3   3 Center 1  20  63\n4   4 Center 1  26 109\n5   5 Center 1  21  86\n6   6 Center 1  24 105\n7   7 Center 1  27  96\n8   8 Center 1  27  64\n9   9 Center 1  29  67\n10 10 Center 1  24 105\n11 11 Center 2  21 117\n12 12 Center 2  21  40\n13 13 Center 2  26  88\n14 14 Center 2  31  40\n15 15 Center 2  21 128\n16 16 Center 2  20  57\n17 17 Center 2  26 135\n18 18 Center 2  27  85\n19 19 Center 2  27 108\n20 20 Center 2  22  48\n\ndf_4\n\n   ID   Status\n1   1      ICU\n2   2 Deceased\n3   3      ICU\n4   4      ICU\n5   6 Deceased\n6   7      ICU\n7   8 Hospital\n8   9 Deceased\n9  11      ICU\n10 12 Hospital\n11 13      ICU\n12 14 Deceased\n13 16      ICU\n14 17 Hospital\n15 18 Hospital\n16 19 Hospital\n17 20      ICU\n18 21 Deceased\n19 22 Deceased\n20 23      ICU\n21 24 Hospital\n22 25 Hospital\n\n\nCompare what the four different ways of merging do to the data:\n\ndata_inner &lt;- merge(data_baseline, df_4, by = \"ID\")  \ndata_left &lt;- merge(data_baseline, df_4, by = \"ID\", all.x = TRUE)  \ndata_right &lt;- merge(data_baseline, df_4, by = \"ID\", all.y = TRUE)  \ndata_full &lt;- merge(data_baseline, df_4, by = \"ID\", all = TRUE)  \n\ndata_inner\n\n   ID   Center BMI CRP   Status\n1   1 Center 1  24  84      ICU\n2   2 Center 1  24  71 Deceased\n3   3 Center 1  20  63      ICU\n4   4 Center 1  26 109      ICU\n5   6 Center 1  24 105 Deceased\n6   7 Center 1  27  96      ICU\n7   8 Center 1  27  64 Hospital\n8   9 Center 1  29  67 Deceased\n9  11 Center 2  21 117      ICU\n10 12 Center 2  21  40 Hospital\n11 13 Center 2  26  88      ICU\n12 14 Center 2  31  40 Deceased\n13 16 Center 2  20  57      ICU\n14 17 Center 2  26 135 Hospital\n15 18 Center 2  27  85 Hospital\n16 19 Center 2  27 108 Hospital\n17 20 Center 2  22  48      ICU\n\ndata_left\n\n   ID   Center BMI CRP   Status\n1   1 Center 1  24  84      ICU\n2   2 Center 1  24  71 Deceased\n3   3 Center 1  20  63      ICU\n4   4 Center 1  26 109      ICU\n5   5 Center 1  21  86     &lt;NA&gt;\n6   6 Center 1  24 105 Deceased\n7   7 Center 1  27  96      ICU\n8   8 Center 1  27  64 Hospital\n9   9 Center 1  29  67 Deceased\n10 10 Center 1  24 105     &lt;NA&gt;\n11 11 Center 2  21 117      ICU\n12 12 Center 2  21  40 Hospital\n13 13 Center 2  26  88      ICU\n14 14 Center 2  31  40 Deceased\n15 15 Center 2  21 128     &lt;NA&gt;\n16 16 Center 2  20  57      ICU\n17 17 Center 2  26 135 Hospital\n18 18 Center 2  27  85 Hospital\n19 19 Center 2  27 108 Hospital\n20 20 Center 2  22  48      ICU\n\ndata_right\n\n   ID   Center BMI CRP   Status\n1   1 Center 1  24  84      ICU\n2   2 Center 1  24  71 Deceased\n3   3 Center 1  20  63      ICU\n4   4 Center 1  26 109      ICU\n5   6 Center 1  24 105 Deceased\n6   7 Center 1  27  96      ICU\n7   8 Center 1  27  64 Hospital\n8   9 Center 1  29  67 Deceased\n9  11 Center 2  21 117      ICU\n10 12 Center 2  21  40 Hospital\n11 13 Center 2  26  88      ICU\n12 14 Center 2  31  40 Deceased\n13 16 Center 2  20  57      ICU\n14 17 Center 2  26 135 Hospital\n15 18 Center 2  27  85 Hospital\n16 19 Center 2  27 108 Hospital\n17 20 Center 2  22  48      ICU\n18 21     &lt;NA&gt;  NA  NA Deceased\n19 22     &lt;NA&gt;  NA  NA Deceased\n20 23     &lt;NA&gt;  NA  NA      ICU\n21 24     &lt;NA&gt;  NA  NA Hospital\n22 25     &lt;NA&gt;  NA  NA Hospital\n\ndata_full\n\n   ID   Center BMI CRP   Status\n1   1 Center 1  24  84      ICU\n2   2 Center 1  24  71 Deceased\n3   3 Center 1  20  63      ICU\n4   4 Center 1  26 109      ICU\n5   5 Center 1  21  86     &lt;NA&gt;\n6   6 Center 1  24 105 Deceased\n7   7 Center 1  27  96      ICU\n8   8 Center 1  27  64 Hospital\n9   9 Center 1  29  67 Deceased\n10 10 Center 1  24 105     &lt;NA&gt;\n11 11 Center 2  21 117      ICU\n12 12 Center 2  21  40 Hospital\n13 13 Center 2  26  88      ICU\n14 14 Center 2  31  40 Deceased\n15 15 Center 2  21 128     &lt;NA&gt;\n16 16 Center 2  20  57      ICU\n17 17 Center 2  26 135 Hospital\n18 18 Center 2  27  85 Hospital\n19 19 Center 2  27 108 Hospital\n20 20 Center 2  22  48      ICU\n21 21     &lt;NA&gt;  NA  NA Deceased\n22 22     &lt;NA&gt;  NA  NA Deceased\n23 23     &lt;NA&gt;  NA  NA      ICU\n24 24     &lt;NA&gt;  NA  NA Hospital\n25 25     &lt;NA&gt;  NA  NA Hospital\n\n\n\n\nMerge multiple data sets\nIt is possible to merge multiple data sets by creating a list of data set and using the function Reduce().
