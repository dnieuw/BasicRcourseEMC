# Importing and Saving Data



Because the typical way of using `R` involves writing text into a file with the `.r` or `.R` extension (e.g. `my-r-file.r`). Hopefully you're you are also doing this for the R commands you will use for this course. Sometimes you will also want to save your data.

## Creating and saving an R script

You can create a new R file using the menu (File > New File > R script) or by using the keyboard combination {{< kbd win=Ctrl+Shift+N mac=Cmd+Shift+N >}}. You are then prompted for a file name. When you want to save the file you can do so using the menu again (File > Save) or by pressing {{< kbd win=Ctrl+S mac=Cmd+S >}}. Selecting 'File > Save as ...' saves the active file under another name.

## Saving and restoring your session

Save all objects to the working directory in a file called `.RData`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
save.image()
```

Or give the file a name:

```{r}
#| eval: false
save.image("mySession.RData") 
```

Save all commands entered into the `R` console during your session to the working directory in a file called `.Rhistory`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
savehistory()
```

Such a file may be hidden by default in some file browsers, including linux.

Note that this typically occurs (console dependent) by default when you quit your `R` session. If an `.Rhistory` file already exists from a previous session, the current session is appended to the end of this file and saved. Thus, by design, a complete log of your work is saved together with your script file, if your console session contains less than 512 lines.

Save specific objects:

```{r}
#| eval: false
save(object_1, object_2, object_3, file = "rObjects123.RData")
```

Restore or load previous sessions or objects:

```{r}
#| eval: false
load("mySession.RData")        # load from the working directory
```

When you save and load objects this way, loaded variables will have the same names as when they were stored. There is also a different way of saving objects where loaded objects are assigned explicitly.

```{r}
myobject <- list(vec=c(1, 2, 3), mat=matrix(1:4,2))
saveRDS(myobject,file = 'myfile.rds')
object2 <- readRDS('myfile.rds')
identical(myobject, object2)
```

Often the data we want to use is not in any 'R-format' but in another format. We will then have to import this data. Much of this functionality is included in the `foreign` package. To open data from spss you can use the `read.spss` command from this package. The syntax is:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(foreign)
read.spss(file = 'path/to/file/thespssfile.sav', to.data.frame = TRUE)
```

Using the argument `to.data.frame` we indicate that we want the result as a data.frame. Another format that is often used is excel sheets; for this we can use the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
read_excel(path='path/to/file/excelworkbook.xls')
```

This function has an optional argument `sheet` to indicate the sheet in the excel file if it contains multiple sheets. Optionally, with `range` a cell range can be indicated.

Load `.Rhistory` file to access the history from the console:

```{r}
#| eval: false
loadhistory()
```
