## Basic Plotting: Questions

Use R to do the following exercises on the BOD data

::: panel-tabset
### Question 1
Display the built-in dataset called BOD by running BOD.
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 2
What is the data structure of BOD? What are the dimensions?
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 3
What are the names of BOD? Use a function other than str.
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 3
Make a line graph of demand versus time, where the line is a deep pink dot-dashed line [Hint: run ?par and look for the parameter lty to see the line types]. Add a blue dashed line of 1.1 times the demand and give it a thickness of 2 using the line width parameter lwd. Make sure both lines are entirely visible by adjusting the range of y using the parameter ylim in the original plot.

Use R to do the following exercises on the chickwts data.

::: panel-tabset
### Question 4
Display the built-in chickwts data.
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 5
What are the names of chickwts? Use a function other than str
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 6
What are the levels of feed?
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 7
Make the following plots in one 2 x 2 image:
- A bar chart of the feed types, each bar a different color.
- A bar chart of the proportions of feed types, each bar a different color.
- A boxplot of the weights by feed type, each box a different color.
- A horizontal boxplot of the weights by feed type, each box a different color.

Use R to do the following exercises on the Puromycin data.

::: panel-tabset
### Question 8
Display the built-in Puromycin data.
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 9
Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the concentration. Describe the relationship.
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 10
Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the log of the concentration. Describe the relationship.
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 11
Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the log of the concentration and color the points by treatment group (state). Describe what you see.
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 12
Make a scatterplot of the rate versus the log of the concentration, color the points by treatment group (state), label the x-axis "Concentration" and the y-axis "Rate", and label the plot "Puromycin".
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 13
Add a legend to the above plot indicating what the points represent.
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 14
Make a boxplot of the treated versus untreated rates. Using the function pdf, save the image to a file with a width and height of 7 inches.
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 15
Make a histogram of the frequency of concentrations. What is the width of the bins?
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 16
Make a histogram of the frequency of concentrations with a bin width of 0.10. How is this different from the histogram above?
:::

::: panel-tabset
### Question 17
Plot the histograms side by side in the same graphic window and make sure they have the same range on the y-axis. Does this make it easier to answer the question of how the two histograms differ?
