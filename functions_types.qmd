# Types of available functions

### Built-in Named Functions

R has an extensive set of built-in functions, a few of which are listed below:

Print structure of an object:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str()
```

Print class of an object:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
class()
```

First six elements/rows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head()
```

Last six elements/rows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tail()
```

List all objects and functions that you currently made:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ls()
```

Generate a sequence of values:

```{r}
seq(from=1, to=10, by=2)
```

Run the entire contents of a script:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("myScript.R")
```

For a (very long) list of all named functions available in base-R have a look at this website:
